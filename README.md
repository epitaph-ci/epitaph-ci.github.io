# Epitaph CI

> A self-hosted CI (Continuous Integration) suite, built on NodeJS and Docker

## Getting Started (CI-Server)

* To get started on Google Application Engine(GAE), see [GAE Install Guide](gae-install-guide)
* To get started on Linux, see [Linux Install Guide](linux-install-guide)
* To get started on Mac, see [OSX Install Guide](osx-install-guide)
* Although the code of Epitaph CI is compatible with Windows and I'm mainly working on Windows, there's a problem that docker cannot be installed and ran directly on Windows 7 and below, but there's a solution for Windows 10, see [Windows 10 Install Guide](win10-install-guide)

## Getting Started (CI CLI Tool)

See [Getting Started (CLI)](getting-started-cli)
